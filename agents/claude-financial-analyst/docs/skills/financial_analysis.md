## What This Document Is

This guide helps you create the Financial Analysis skill for Claude Code. The skill itself must live in the `.claude` directory (which is gitignored) for Claude Code to discover and use it.

## What the Skill Does

Once created, the Financial Analysis skill transforms Claude Code into an expert financial analyst with comprehensive capabilities across all aspects of financial statement analysis.

## Creating the Skill

### Source Material

The skill is based on [financial_analysis_guide.md](../financial_analysis_guide.md), which contains:

- Complete financial analysis frameworks
- Seven analysis domains with detailed methodologies
- Industry-specific interpretation guidelines
- Best practices and workflows
- Metric definitions and formulas
- Generated by Claude through using Research mode with Extended Thinking

### Step-by-Step Creation

**1. Review the comprehensive guide:**

Read through [financial_analysis_guide.md](../financial_analysis_guide.md) to understand the full analytical framework.

**2. Use Claude Code to generate the skill:**

Ask Claude Code to create the skill structure:

```texs
Create a Financial Analysis skill in .claude/skills/financial_analysis/ based on
@financial_analysis_guide.md

Structure needed:
1. SKILL.md - Main skill definition with frontmatter and complete framework
2. references/ subdirectory with 7 detailed reference documents:
   - profitability_analysis.md
   - liquidity_analysis.md
   - leverage_analysis.md
   - efficiency_analysis.md
   - cashflow_analysis.md
   - quality_analysis.md
   - valuation_analysis.md

Each file should contain appropriate depth - SKILL.md provides overview and workflow,
references provide detailed metrics, formulas, and interpretation guidelines.
```

**3. Verify the structure:**

After creation, you should have:

```texs
.claude/skills/financial_analysis/
├── SKILL.md                      ← Main skill file (REQUIRED by Claude Code)
└── references/                   ← Supporting docs (referenced by SKILL.md)
    ├── profitability_analysis.md
    ├── liquidity_analysis.md
    ├── leverage_analysis.md
    ├── efficiency_analysis.md
    ├── cashflow_analysis.md
    ├── quality_analysis.md
    └── valuation_analysis.md
```

**4. Required frontmatter for SKILL.md:**

The main `SKILL.md` file MUST include this YAML frontmatter for Claude Code to discover it:

```yaml
---
name: financial-analysis
description: Comprehensive financial statement analysis including profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, cash flow, quality, and valuation metrics. Use when analyzing companies, comparing financial performance, or assessing investment opportunities.
---
```

## What the Skill Provides

Once created and invoked with `/skill financial_analysis`, Claude Code gains:

### Seven Analysis Domains

1. **Profitability Analysis** - How effectively companies convert revenue into profits
2. **Liquidity Analysis** - Ability to meet short-term obligations
3. **Leverage Analysis** - Capital structure and financial risk from debt
4. **Efficiency Analysis** - Effectiveness of asset deployment and working capital management
5. **Cash Flow Analysis** - Quality and sustainability of cash generation
6. **Quality Analysis** - Earnings quality and financial reporting integrity
7. **Valuation Analysis** - Market valuation using multiples and fundamentals

### Analytical Capabilities

- Multi-dimensional company analysis across all domains
- Industry-specific interpretation and benchmarks
- Peer comparison frameworks
- Trend identification and red flag detection
- Strategic insights and actionable recommendations
- Integrated workflow from data gathering to reporting

## Integration with Data Querying Skill

The Financial Analysis skill works together with the [Data Querying skill](./data_querying.md) to:

1. Query financial data from Databricks tables
2. Apply analytical frameworks to the retrieved data
3. Generate comprehensive insights and recommendations

## Why Skills Must Be in `.claude`

**Critical**: Claude Code only discovers skills in the `.claude/skills/` directory. Skills placed elsewhere will not work.

- The `.claude` directory is scanned automatically by Claude Code
- The `SKILL.md` naming convention is required
- The frontmatter format enables proper skill registration
- Skills outside `.claude/skills/` are invisible to Claude Code

## Customization Options

When generating your skill, consider customizing:

- **Industry focus** - Emphasize sectors you analyze most
- **Analysis depth** - Adjust detail level per domain based on usage
- **Workflows** - Tailor analytical steps to your objectives (investment, credit, M&A)
- **Benchmarks** - Add company or industry-specific thresholds
- **Frameworks** - Incorporate your organization's proprietary methods

## Invoking the Skill

Once created, invoke with:

- `/skill financial_analysis` - Explicit invocation
- Automatic - Claude Code may invoke automatically when financial analysis is needed
